I made this for a friend due to some *unique* circumstances where the usual therapy method of writing notes and then burning them was not an option. Through this webpage, you can perform this action virtually, and *instantly* take the note out of existence at a moment's notice.

A more "theraputic" animation-based (but not instant) note "burning" animation is on my mind, but I'm not sure if I'll ever get around to it, unfortunately.

Take care of your mental health, friends. It's a tough world out there sometimes, but whoever you are, I believe in you.
